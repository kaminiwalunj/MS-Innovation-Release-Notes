### Summary of Changes

Updated pyproject.toml file to pin the Agent Framework version and align it with the OpenAI SDK. Removed semantic-kernel==1.35.0, which was not required for this lab and caused conflicts within the OpenAI client stack. The updates reflect the latest changes from the Microsoft repository.
- Added an __init__.py file to tell Python that a directory should be treated as a package. Without __init__.py, Python may not recognize the folder as an importable package.
