### Testing Scope 

- Performed End-to-end testing has been completed successfully with full validation. All lab steps were executed without any issues, and all validations passed with no errors. Everything is good with the lab.
  - **Note:** A quota-related issue may occur in the East US 2 region or others. I faced the issue below during testing, and redeploying the lab to West Europe resolved it.
    - **Error Faced:** Subscription quota limitation for Basic VM SKUs prevented the deployment .
